Personal project game where the goal is to make the phrase "Hello World" appear as output, with constraints of varying difficulty in each 'World' (level). 

Currently the game is being made using only HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS, but my plan is to refactor the project using MERN stack once the basic functionality of the game is playable. 

Current MERN ideas:
MongoDB: For storing World objects containing difficulty/name/hint/play() attributes. 
Express & Node: API calls to fetch World objects from DB to use in games. 
React: For frontend.
